## My Journey in Computer Science
Introduction
My journey in Computer Science began with problem-solving exercises in the Assiut sheet. This initial step provided me with a strong foundation and helped me make significant progress in understanding the basics of computer science.

## Data Structures with Dr. Mostafa Saad
I then embarked on a data structure course under the guidance of Dr. Mostafa Saad. Here, I delved into the world of vectors and single linked lists. The course was challenging but rewarding, and I successfully completed all the assignments.

## Next Steps
The next step in my journey is to learn about doubly linked lists. I am excited about this new challenge and look forward to expanding my knowledge in data structures.

This journey has been an exciting one so far, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in the field of Computer Science. Stay tuned for more updates on my progress! ðŸ˜Š
